# Snake Game üêç

A simple and classic Snake Game implemented in Java using the Swing framework for graphical user interface.



## Features

- Dynamic gameplay with increasing difficulty as the snake grows.
- Fully functional scoring system displayed on the screen.
- Responsive controls for smooth gameplay.
- Game over screen with the final score.



## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Java Development Kit (JDK)**: Ensure you have JDK 8 or later installed.
- A code editor or IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, VS Code).

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/GithubSneha2004/Snake-Game.git
   cd Snake-Game
   ```

2. Open the project in your IDE.

3. Compile and run the `SnakeGame.java` file to start the game.



## Project Structure

- **SnakeGame.java**: The main entry point of the game.
- **GameFrame.java**: Handles the game window and its properties.
- **GamePanel.java**: Implements the game's logic, including rendering, controls, collision detection, and scoring.



## How to Play

1. Use the arrow keys (`‚Üë`, `‚Üì`, `‚Üê`, `‚Üí`) to control the snake's movement.
2. Eat the red apples to grow the snake and increase your score.
3. Avoid colliding with the walls or the snake's own body.
4. The game ends when the snake crashes.


## Controls

- **Arrow Keys**:
  - `‚Üë`: Move Up
  - `‚Üì`: Move Down
  - `‚Üê`: Move Left
  - `‚Üí`: Move Right


## Technologies Used

- **Java**
- **Swing**: For the graphical interface.
- **AWT**: For rendering and handling user inputs.


## Future Enhancements

- Add difficulty levels.
- Implement a high-score leaderboard.
- Introduce new gameplay mechanics, such as obstacles or power-ups.


## Acknowledgments

- Inspired by the classic Snake game that many of us played on old mobile phones.
- Created as a learning project to explore Java Swing and game development.
